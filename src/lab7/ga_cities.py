Lab 7: Realistic Cities 

In this lab you will try to generate realistic cities using a genetic algorithm.
Your cities should not be under water, and should have a realistic distribution across the landscape.
Your cities may also not be on top of mountains or on top of each other.
Create the fitness function for your genetic algorithm, so that it fulfills these criterion
and then use it to generate a population of cities.

Please comment your code in the fitness function to explain how are you making sure each criterion is 
fulfilled. Clearly explain in comments which line of code and variables are used to fulfill each criterion.
